# Résumé

I've heard a lot of conflicting advice about what a résumé should look like. Everyone's opinion is different. 
Some people insist on it fitting into one page, two pages, or many pages. 
Some want it to look good on a screen (company logos, hyperlinks). Others want plain text with more whitespace to print on paper. 
Some want every skill or tool I've ever used to be listed, others want it to be succinct. 
Many people think that the reason I can't get a job is because my résumé looks awful, but I think that the real reason is because I don't know how to send it to companies. 


Version 1 fits a brief summary into two pages:

Version 2 takes seven pages to describe everything in detail:

Version 3 only lists some roles, so there are gaps in the dates. Each of those jobs is described in more detail, taking three pages.
